# Cyberbully Detection on Social Media with Machine Learning

## Introduction
In the digital age, social media has become a central platform for communication and interaction. However, it has also given rise to challenges like cyberbullying, affecting the well-being of individuals. This project demonstrates my ability to tackle such pressing social issues using data science and machine learning, showcasing a model designed to effectively classify and identify cyberbullying behavior across social media posts.

## Project Highlights
- **Real-World Application**: Developed an NLP-based machine learning model addressing the critical issue of cyberbullying, demonstrating my commitment to leveraging technology for social good.
- **Technical Expertise**: Utilized Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, alongside the vaderSentiment library for sentiment analysis, showcasing my proficiency in essential data science tools and libraries.
- **Innovative Approach**: Employed advanced text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction with CountVectorizer, and sentiment analysis to enhance model accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Model Evaluation**: Rigorously tested and evaluated using key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), underscoring my thorough understanding of machine learning model assessment.

## Core Technologies
